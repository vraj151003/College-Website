             <p>L.D. College of Engineering (LDCE) was established on 20th June, 1948 as one of the first few engineering colleges in India. The institution owes its foundation to the bold and inspired vision of Kasturbhai Lalbhai, who named the college after his father, Lalbhai Dalpatbhai.
                <br><br>
                Initially affiliated to Bombay University, L.D. College of Engineering (LDCE) came under the Gujarat University after its establishment in 1949.
